abstract: This paper considers security in eavesdropping attacks over wireless communication links in aeronautical telemetry systems. Here, we propose a secure coding technique for the integrated Network Enhanced Telemetry (iNET) communications system that can be coupled with modern encryption schemes. We consider a wiretap scenario where there are two telemetry links between a test article (TA) and a legitimate receiver, or ground station (GS). We show how these two links can be used to transmit both encrypted and unencrypted data streams while keeping both streams secure.
