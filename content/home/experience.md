  The outcomes of my Ph.D. research involve:
  
  * Discovered new properties of secret error-correcting coding (SECC) from the perspectives of information and coding theory.
  * Devised a high-speed algorithm to construct the optimal code in Nested Linear Secrecy Codes, enhancing code identification and selection efficiency.
  * Conducted a detailed assessment and visualized secrecy problems such as eavesdropping in aeronautical mobile telemetry communication and suggested the use of secrecy coding and specialized version of post-quantum cryptosystems for this type of communication system.
